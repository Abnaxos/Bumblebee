## Server options
[bumblebeed]
# remember that client does not have to be optirun, a client is any program that communicates through the protocol, which can be Bumblebee UI for example. "Keep" makes more sense for a power-saving behavior.
KeepUnusedXServer=false
# GID looks like a number, but we really talk about names
ServerGroup=bumblebee
# Card power state at exit
# if it's true, it'll make on/off -> on. If false, on/off -> off
TurnCardOffAtExit=false
# Should default behavior on Battery power be forced? This will allow for the use of "-f" option in optirun. STAGED FOR 3.1, not 3.0
 # unless it is a policy or sth, it should be overridable by default, OK
NoEcoModeOverride=false
# VGL refers to the technology, keeping it as now (fine for me btw, alt: SECONDARY_DISPLAY)? (V_DISPLAY for virtual)
VirtualDisplay=:8
# wait, driver can be "nvidia-current" as it refers to the kernel module filename. Shouldn't we use Module here? No, This is the driver used by bumblebeed. Based on this it will use the driver-DRIVER section for the relevant options
Driver=nouveau
## Client options
[optirun]
# This is really specific to VGL and can't be used in other programs for sure. Will eventually be deprecated.
VGLTransport=proxy
# "start if server is unavailable" --- **magic words machine** -> (the below can be improved as well)
AlwaysRunProgram=false
# proposals for the above:
AllowFallbackToIGC=false
## Section with nvidia specific options
[nvidia]
#Just to be sure none confuses this drver with the one in bbd section

LibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-bumblebee
# for clarity prepend Xorg

## Section with nouveau specific options
[nouveau]

### Bumblebee daemon/client configuration file.
# Boolean options accept 'true' or 'false'
# Lines starting with a '#' are comments and ignored. If you change an option, do
# not forget to remove the sharp sign (#) preceding the directive.

###
### Modifications made here will need a daemon restart to take effect.
###

# If set to 'true', the X server is stopped after the last optirun client. If set
# to 'false', the card will always be enabled after the first optirun instance.
# This option might be removed in the future as it was a workaround for an old
# bug. You usually do not want to set this to 'false'.
#STOP_SERVICE_ON_EXIT=@CONF_STOPONEXIT@

# Display for the nVidia X Server, choose a higher display (e.g. :5) if you use
# Fast User Switching which starts incrementing from :0 (:0, :1, :2, ...).
#VGL_DISPLAY=@CONF_XDISP@

# Driver to be used. This value is autodetected, but if you want to force
# Bumblebee to use a specific driver, uncomment this line and specify the
# driver (nvidia or nouveau). See also NV_LIBRARY_PATH
#DRIVER=@CONF_DRIVER@

## Nvidia driver configuration
[nvidia]
# Kernel module which loads the driver. This option should only be used if the
# name of the driver and kernel module differs, and if the name of the kernel
# module is not "nvidia-current" nor "nvidia" for DRIVER=nvidia. An empty value
# copies the value of DRIVER or for nvidia, "nvidia" or "nvidia-current".
#DRIVER_MODULE=@CONF_DRIVER_MODULE@

# The Xorg configuration to be used, leaving it empty will base the file on the
# driver name, which is usually /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.DRIVER.
#X_CONFFILE=@CONF_XORG@

# If nvidia is set as driver the daemon will need a way to figure out where to
# find the nvidia libraries. This option also sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var
# for optirun programs to allow the graphics library to be found. This option
# is not needed for nouveau. Multiple directories can be specified by
# separating the values with a colon.
#NV_LIBRARY_PATH=@CONF_LDPATH@

# An override for the path to Xorg modules. If you're using the nvidia driver,
# you need to put the directory containing nvidia_drv.so in it, a comma and
# the default Xorg modules directory. Multiple paths are separated by commas
#MODULE_PATH=@CONF_MODPATH@

# The group that is allowed to use Bumblebee. Note that the user needs to
# re-login for group membership changes to apply.
#BUMBLEBEE_GROUP=@CONF_GID@

# Enable power management with the specified method. Possible values are
# none - disable power management, just what the legacy ENABLE_POWER_MANAGEMENT
#        option (which is removed) did
# auto - try to detect available methods (default if unspecified)
# bbswitch - only try the bbswitch kernel module
# switcheroo - only try vga_switcheroo which can only be used with nouveau
# if a method is not available, PM will be disabled. See also:
# https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Comparison-of-PM-methods
#PM_METHOD=@CONF_PM_METHOD@

# If set to '0', the discrete card will stay disabled after shutdown of the
# Bumblebee daemon. Do not set this value to '0' when uninstalling. Usually
# you want to keep this value at '1'.
#CARD_SHUTDOWN_STATE=@CONF_SHUTDOWNSTATE@

###
### The below only affects optirun, restarting the daemon is not necessary
###

# Image transport from bumblebee X server to screen.
# Possible values: proxy, jpeg, rgb, xv or yuv
#VGL_COMPRESS=@CONF_VGLCOMPRESS@

# Fall back on using the Intel graphics card if the nVidia one is not available.
# If disabled, optirun will quit after displaying an error message. A value of
# '1' will make a program still be executed even if the Bumblebee daemon is not
# available.
#FALLBACK_START=@CONF_FALLBACKSTART@
