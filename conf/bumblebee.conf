### Bumblebee daemon/client configuration file.
# Boolean options accept '1' and '0'. Do not use true/false. N/Y is
# deprecated and will be removed in the future.
# Lines starting with a # are comments and ignored. If you change an option, do
# not forget to remove the sharp sign (#) preceding the directive. 

###
### Modifications made here will need a daemon restart to take effect.
###

# If set to '1', the X server is stopped after the last optirun client. If set
# to '0', the card will always be enabled after the first optirun instance.
# This option might be removed in the future as it was a workaround for an old
# bug. You usually do not want to set this to 0.
#STOP_SERVICE_ON_EXIT=1

# Display for the nVidia X Server, choose a higher display (e.g. :5) if you use
# Fast User Switching which starts incrementing from :0 (:0, :1, :2, ...).
#VGL_DISPLAY=:8

# Driver to be used. This value is autodetected, but if you want to force
# Bumblebee to use a specific driver, uncomment this line and specify the
# driver (nvidia or nouveau). See also NV_LIBRARY_PATH
#DRIVER=
# Kernel module which loads the driver. This option should only be used if the
# name of the driver and kernel module differs, and if the name of the kernel
# module is not "nvidia-current" nor "nvidia" for DRIVER=nvidia. An empty value
# copies the value of DRIVER or for nvidia, "nvidia" or "nvidia-current".
#DRIVER_MODULE=

# The Xorg configuration to be used, leaving it empty will base the file on the
# driver name, which is usually /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.DRIVER.
#X_CONFFILE=

# If nvidia is set as driver the daemon will need a way to figure out where to
# find the nvidia libraries. This option also sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var
# for optirun programs to allow the graphics library to be found. This option
# is not needed for nouveau. Multiple directories can be specified by
# separating the values with a colon.
#NV_LIBRARY_PATH=

# An override for the path to Xorg modules. If you're using the nvidia driver,
# you need to put the directory containing nvidia_drv.so in it, a comma and
# the default Xorg modules directory. Multiple paths are separated by commas
#MODULE_PATH=

# The group that is allowed to use Bumblebee. Note that the user needs to
# re-login for group membership changes to apply.
#BUMBLEBEE_GROUP=bumblebee

# Enable power management with the specified method. Possible values are
# none - disable power management, just what the legacy ENABLE_POWER_MANAGEMENT
#        option (which is removed) did
# auto - try to detect available methods (default if unspecified)
# bbswitch - only try the bbswitch kernel module
# switcheroo - only try vga_switcheroo which can only be used with nouveau
# if a method is not available, PM will be disabled. See also:
# https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Comparison-of-PM-methods
#PM_METHOD=auto

# If set to '0', the discrete card will stay disabled after shutdown of the
# Bumblebee daemon. Do not set this value to '0' when uninstalling. Usually
# you want to keep this value at '1'.
#CARD_SHUTDOWN_STATE=1

###
### The below only affects optirun, restarting the daemon is not necessary
###

# Image transport from bumblebee X server to screen.
# Possible values: proxy, jpeg, rgb, xv or yuv
#VGL_COMPRESS=proxy

# Fall back on using the Intel graphics card if the nVidia one is not available.
# If disabled, optirun will quit after displaying an error message. A value of
# '1' will make a program still be executed even if the Bumblebee daemon is not
# available.
#FALLBACK_START=1
